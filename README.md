# Terminal Emulator for Resume

https://bwfischer.github.io/terminal-resume/

This project is a terminal emulator designed to display a resume in a retro-themed environment. It provides functionality akin to a classic terminal interface, allowing users to navigate through the resume content using function keys and perform actions like copying contact information, toggling themes, saving the page as a bookmark, and more.

## Features

### 1. Retro Terminal Interface
- The terminal interface mimics the appearance of a classic terminal, with a green or amber color theme reminiscent of old computer screens.
- It includes a header displaying function key shortcuts and a footer showing the date and time.

### 2. Resume Content Display
- The main section of the terminal displays the resume content in a typewriter-style animation, adding a retro touch to the viewing experience.
- Resume content includes personal information, professional experience, skills, contact details, and an authentication security key.

### 3. Function Key Shortcuts
- Users can interact with the terminal using function key shortcuts (F1 to F10) to perform various actions:
    - **F1**: Display help summary.
    - **F2**: Save the page as a bookmark.
    - **F3**: Initiate a search function (currently reserved).
    - **F4**: Exit the terminal and reload the page.
    - **F5**: Open contact information as hyperlinks.
    - **F6**: Copy contact information to the clipboard.
    - **F7**: Paste copied content (currently reserved).
    - **F8**: Toggle between green and amber color themes.
    - **F9**: Reapply undone action (currently reserved).
    - **F10**: Quit or exit the program by redirecting to a LinkedIn profile.

### 4. Dynamic Content Updates
- The terminal dynamically updates the current date and time in the footer.
- It supports opacity adjustment using a dimmer slider for improved readability.

## Usage

### Viewing the Resume
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Interact with the terminal using function key shortcuts to navigate through the resume content and perform actions.

### Functionality
- Use function keys F1 to F10 to trigger specific actions as described in the features section.
- The resume content will be displayed in a typewriter animation upon loading the page.
- The terminal provides visual feedback for certain actions, such as copying information or toggling themes.

### Customization
- Developers can customize the appearance and behavior of the terminal by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Themes, animations, and functionality can be tailored to suit individual preferences or integrate additional features.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Structure and markup of the terminal interface and content.
- CSS: Styling the terminal interface to achieve the retro theme and layout.
- JavaScript: Implementing dynamic behavior, function key shortcuts, and content rendering.
- Browser APIs: Utilizing browser functionalities like copying to clipboard, reloading the page, and accessing browser bookmarks.

## Future Enhancements
1. Implementing the search functionality (F3) to enable searching within the resume content.
2. Enhancing accessibility features to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
3. Adding more interactive elements or sections to enrich the user experience.
4. Optimizing code structure and performance for better maintainability and scalability.
