This project is a terminal emulator designed to display a resume in a retro-themed environment. It provides functionality akin to a classic terminal interface, allowing users to navigate through the resume content using function keys and perform actions like copying contact information, toggling themes, saving the page as a bookmark, and more.

## Features

### 1. Retro Terminal Interface
- The terminal interface mimics the appearance of a classic terminal, with a green or amber color theme reminiscent of old computer screens.
- It includes a header displaying function key shortcuts and a footer showing the date and time.

### 2. Resume Content Display
- The main section of the terminal displays the resume content in a typewriter-style animation, adding a retro touch to the viewing experience.
- Resume content includes personal information, professional experience, skills, contact details, and an authentication security key.

### 3. Function Key Shortcuts
- Users can interact with the terminal using function key shortcuts (F1 to F10) to perform various actions:
    - **F1**: Display help summary.
    - **F2**: Save the page as a bookmark.
    - **F3**: Initiate a search function (currently reserved).
    - **F4**: Exit the terminal and reload the page.
    - **F5**: Open contact information as hyperlinks.
    - **F6**: Copy contact information to the clipboard.
    - **F7**: Paste copied content (currently reserved).
    - **F8**: Toggle between green and amber color themes.
    - **F9**: Reapply undone action (currently reserved).
    - **F10**: Quit or exit the program by redirecting to a LinkedIn profile.

### 4. Dynamic Content Updates
- The terminal dynamically updates the current date and time in the footer.
- It supports opacity adjustment using a dimmer slider for improved readability.

## 5. Updated Features
